# User Specification: PLC Log Visualizer Reference

## Core Directive
All UI/UX design, color palettes, layout structures, and functional behaviors must strictly follow the **`plc_to_wavedrom`** desktop application as the primary source of truth.

## Key Reference Points
- **Desktop Source:** `/home/dev/work_project/CIM_Visualizer/plc_to_wavedrom`
- **Visual Reference:** `/home/dev/work_project/CIM_Visualizer/plc_to_wavedrom/Assets/Main_Window_Design.png`
- **Theme:** Clean, professional light theme (Navy, Accent Blue, Light Gray/White surface).
- **Navigation:** Big icon-based buttons for main views (Timing Diagram, Log Table, Map Viewer, etc.).
- **Waveform Rendering:** 60px height, light background, specific state rendering (boxes for strings/ints, steps for booleans).

## Permanent Instruction
Do not deviate from these reference styles unless explicitly instructed. If in doubt, check the Python code or assets in `plc_to_wavedrom`.
