## 🚧 Active: Phase 3 — Map Viewer + Carrier Tracking

### Map Configuration Files
- [x] **XML Layout File** — Upload, select, recent list
- [x] **YAML Rules File** — Parser, API, upload/select
- [x] **File Association UI** — Dialog with XML + YAML selection
- [x] **Signal Log Link** — "Use Current Session" to link log table data
- [x] Store device-to-unit mappings for carrier tracking
- [x] Store color rules for signal-based coloring
- [x] Validate both files selected before activating tracking

### Map Rendering ✅
- [x] Load layout from XML config
- [x] Render units/stations as rectangles
- [x] Render paths/conveyors as lines/arrows
- [x] Display labels
- [x] Pan and zoom controls

### Carrier Tracking
- [x] Implement Carrier Tracking logic (map `CurrentLocation` signals)
- [x] Display carriers on units
- [x] Show carrier ID (truncate long IDs from start)
- [x] Multi-carrier count display ("2x", "3x")
- [x] Carrier count colors: 0=default, 1=green, 2=yellow, 3=orange, 4+=red

### Unit Interaction
- [x] Implement unit selection/highlighting
- [x] Click unit → show info panel
- [x] Info panel shows carrier list and current state
- [x] Center view on unit (Reset button)

### Map Media Player (Playback) ✅
- [x] Play/pause button, speed control (0.5x–10x)
- [x] Time scrubber/slider, current time display
- [x] Skip forward/backward buttons
- [x] Map colors update based on playback time
- [x] Sync with log data timestamps

### Follow Feature
- [x] Follow button with search input
- [x] Fuzzy matching for carrier search
- [x] Selection dialog for multiple matches
- [x] View follows carrier on move

## 📋 Backlog: Future Phases

### Phase 4: Bookmarks + Time Sync
- [ ] Ctrl+B add bookmark, Ctrl+Shift+B bookmark list
- [ ] Click bookmark → jump to time
- [ ] Ctrl+]/[ next/prev bookmark
- [ ] Sync Views button (master/slave sync)

### Phase 4.5: Multi-File Merge
- [ ] Select multiple files for upload
- [ ] Merge log entries by timestamp
- [ ] Display source file indicator

### Phase 5: Signal Validation (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Load validation rules from YAML
- [ ] Sequence, timing, value range validators
- [ ] YAML editor with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Results panel with violation navigation

## ⚡ Performance & Stability

- [x] 1GB file uploads successfully (chunked)
- [ ] Parse 1GB file completes (with progress)
- [ ] 100k+ entries in Log Table → smooth scroll
- [ ] 100+ signals in Waveform → smooth pan/zoom
- [x] No browser memory crashes during upload
